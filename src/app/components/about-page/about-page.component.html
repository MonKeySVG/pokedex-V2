      <h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>
      <p>Our application leverages the PokeAPI to fetch detailed information about each Pokémon. We use a combination of Angular services and components to manage data and state efficiently. Here are some interesting details you might not notice at first glance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsive Layout:</strong> The layout adjusts dynamically based on the screen size, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Type Sensitivities:</strong> The sensitivities of each Pokémon are calculated based on their types, providing accurate information about their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> To improve performance, we cache Pokémon data in local storage, reducing the need for repeated API calls.</li>
        <li><strong>Shiny Probability:</strong> There is a 10% probability that a Pokémon will be displayed as shiny, adding an element of surprise and excitement for users.</li>
      </ul>
